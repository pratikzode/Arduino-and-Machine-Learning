# Arduino-and-Machine-Learning
wireless multimodal sensing- Draw inferences over the data coming from sensing hardware (e.g. Temperature, Humidity, Luminosity, etc.,) and processing these samples with the help of machine learning using open source programming tools such as Python. (Any Application: Healthcare, Smart City, Agriculture, etc.).
